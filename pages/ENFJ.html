</p>
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ENFJ preferences are highly attuned to others,
using empathy to quickly understand emotional needs,
motivations, and concerns. Their focus is on supporting
others and encouraging their growth.</p>
<p>ENFJs are friendly persuaders who can often build consensus among people whose interests and motives are quite
diverse. They often act as catalysts, including everyone and
drawing out the best in others. They can be inspiring leaders as well as loyal followers.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ENFJ's</h3>
	<p>ENFJs base decisions on personal values. They use their
Feeling primarily externally, radiating warmth and energy.
They look for and find the best in others and prize harmony
and cooperation. They are warmed by approval, responding
with energy and devotion, and are especially sensitive to
criticism or tensions. ENFJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Warm, compassionate, and supportive</li>
		<li>Loyal and trustworthy</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENFJs see meanings and connections and can be very
insightful about others. They are curious about new ideas
and stimulated by possibilities for contributing to the good
of humanity. ENFJs are likely to</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Be imaginative and creative</li>
		<li>Like variety and new challenges</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENFJs naturally see the potential for growth in others
and devote energy to help others achieve it. They are sensitive facilitators. ENFJs take responsibility for organizing
interactions of colleagues, friends, or family so that all are
involved, harmony prevails, and people have fun.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ENFJs are energetic, enthusiastic, and very aware of others.
Their genuine interest can usually draw out and involve
even the most reserved person. They listen to and support others but also have very definite values and opinions of their own, which they will express clearly. ENFJs are energized by people and are socially adept; however, they also have a strong need for authentic, intimate relationships.
They bring great enthusiasm and intensity to creating and
maintaining these.</p>
	<p>ENFJs like their lives to be organized and will work to
bring closure to ambiguous relationships or situations.
However, if peopleâ€™s needs conflict with schedules and
rules, they will put people first. Others usually see ENFJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Sociable, personable, congenial, and gracious</li>
		<li>Expressive, responsive, and persuasive</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ENFJs in
the development and expression of their Intuitive and Feeling preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, ENFJs may not
see possibilities, making decisions too quickly without
taking in enough information or considering factors
beyond their own personal values.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, their decisions
may be inconsistent and poorly formulated. They may
then accept the judgments of others too readily.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ENFJs do not find a place where they can use their
gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually
feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Worry, feel guilty, and doubt themselves</li>
		<li>Become insistent and controlling in their desire for
harmony</li>
		<li>Be overly sensitive to criticism, real or imagined</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ENFJs to give less attention to their non-
preferred Thinking and Sensing parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Make decisions based solely on personal values when
logic is needed also</li>
		<li>Find it difficult to admit to problems or disagreements
with people they care about</li>
		<li>Overlook details required to realize their ideals</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ENFJs may find themselves suddenly
and uncharacteristically critical and fault-finding with others. They generally keep these negative opinions to themselves, but they find such thoughts troubling and upsetting.</p>
