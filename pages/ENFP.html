<h5><strong>Ne - Fi - Te - Si </strong></h5>
		<p>Warmly enthusiastic and imaginative. See life as full of possibilities. Make connections between events and information very quickly, and confidently proceed based on the patterns they see. Want a lot of affirmation from others, and readily give appreciation and support. Spontaneous and flexible, often rely on their ability to improvise and their verbal fluency.
</p>
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>For people with ENFP preferences, life is a creative adventure full of exciting possibilities. ENFPs are keenly perceptive about people and insightful about the present and
future. They experience a wide range of feelings and intense
emotions. They need affirmation from others and readily
give appreciation and support.</p>
<p>ENFPs are good at understanding how people and
groups work and are persuasive and compelling in pursuing what is important to them. They are adaptable, blooming where they are planted. Their energy and enthusiasm
encourage others to bloom as well.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ENFP's</h3>
	<p>ENFPs are innovators, initiating projects and directing
great energy into getting them under way. Using Intuition
primarily externally, they are stimulated by new people,
ideas, and experiences. They find meaning and significance
readily and see connections that others don’t. They are
likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Curious, creative, and imaginative</li>
		<li>Energetic, enthusiastic, and spontaneous</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENFPs value harmony and goodwill. They like to please
others and will adapt to others’ needs and wishes when possible. ENFPs primarily use Feeling internally, making decisions by applying personal values through identification
and empathy with others. ENFPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Warm, friendly, and caring</li>
		<li>Cooperative and supportive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENFPs have exceptional insight into possibilities in others and the energy and motivation to help actualize them.
They feel confident moving ahead based on their insights,
and their enthusiasm tends to bring others along with
them.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ENFPs are usually lively, gregarious, and sociable, with a
large circle of friends. They are interested in almost everything and bring a zest to life that draws others to them. At
the same time, they value depth and authenticity in their
close relationships and direct great energy to creating and
supporting open and honest communication.</p>
	<p>ENFPs hate routine, schedules, and structure and usually manage to avoid them. They are normally verbally
fluent, even in extemporaneous situations; however, when
their deepest values need expression, they may suddenly be
awkward and express their judgments with uncharacteristic
intensity. Others usually see ENFPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Personable, perceptive, and persuasive</li>
		<li>Enthusiastic, spontaneous, and versatile</li>
		<li>Giving and seeking affirmation</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ENFPs in
the development and expression of their Feeling and Intuitive preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, they may go
from enthusiasm to enthusiasm, never committing the
energy necessary to actualize their insights, or they may
make overly personal decisions.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, they may fail
to take in enough information, lack trust in their own
insights, be uncertain, and accept others’ perceptions too
quickly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ENFPs do not find a place where they can use their
gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually
feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become scattered, have trouble focusing, be easily distracted</li>
		<li>Fail to follow through on decisions</li>
		<li>Become rebellious, excessively nonconforming</li>
		<li>Ignore deadlines and procedures</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ENFPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Sensing and Thinking parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Not take care of the details and routine required for
implementing their inspirations</li>
		<li>Overextend themselves—have trouble saying no to
interesting possibilities and people</li>
		<li>Fail to apply reason and logic to assess their inspirations
and decisions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ENFPs may become overwhelmed by
detail and lose their normal perspective and sense of
options. Then they tend to focus on an unimportant or
distorted detail, letting it become the central fact of their
universe.</p>
