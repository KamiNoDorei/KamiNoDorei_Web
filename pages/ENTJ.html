		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert  i<strong>N</strong>tuiting <strong>T</strong>hinking <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>
		
		<h5><strong>Te - Ni - Se - Fi</strong></h5>

		<p>Frank, decisive, assume leadership readily. Quickly see illogical and inefficient procedures and policies, develop and implement comprehensive systems to solve organizational problems. Enjoy long-term planning and goal setting. Usually well informed, well read, enjoy expanding their knowledge and passing it on to others. Forceful in presenting their ideas.
</p>
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ENTJ preferences are natural leaders and orga-
nization builders. They conceptualize and theorize readily
and translate possibilities into plans to achieve short-term
and long-term objectives. They readily see illogical and
inefficient procedures and feel a strong urge to correct
them—to organize people and situations to get them moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>ENTJs are strategic visionaries, adept at planning for the
future needs of the people and organizations for which they
are responsible.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ENTJ's</h3>
	<p>ENTJs use their Thinking primarily externally and are thus
natural critics. They set their own standards and are force-
ful in applying them to others, to organizations, and to
themselves. They value intelligence and competence and
abhor inefficiency or ignorance. They can be tough when
the situation calls for toughness. ENTJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Analytical, logical, and objectively critical</li>
		<li>Decisive, clear, and assertive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENTJs are intellectually curious, seek new ideas, and
like complex problems. They use their Intuition primarily
internally to conceive possibilities and create the insights
they use in making decisions and plans. ENTJs are likely
to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Conceptual and global thinkers</li>
		<li>Innovative theorizers and planners</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENTJs are usually excellent solvers of organizational
problems. They are keenly aware of the intricate connections within organizations and are action oriented and
strategic—they think ahead, anticipate problems, devise
broad plans and systems, and marshal human and material
resources to achieve goals. They are generally disinterested in routine maintenance activities, preferring new
challenges.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ENTJs love, and are energized by, stimulating interactions
with people. They often challenge people’s statements and
behaviors, expecting that others will defend them and that,
as a result, mutual learning will take place. ENTJs admire
and seek out people who are knowledgeable and who stand
up to them, say what they think, and argue persuasively.</p>
	<p>ENTJs prefer that things be settled and clear, but their
love of ideas can pull them into wide-ranging Intuitive
exploration and discussions. Their verbal fluency, decisiveness, self-confidence, and urge to organize others can over-
power people at times. Others usually see ENTJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Direct, challenging, and decisive</li>
		<li>Objective, fair, and stimulating</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ENTJs in
the development and expression of their Intuitive and
Thinking preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, ENTJs may
make decisions too quickly without considering alternatives or exploring possibilities. In this case, their deci-
siveness can become dictatorial.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, they may not
have a reliable way to evaluate their insights and make
plans. Then their decision making will be inconsistent
and changeable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ENTJs do not find a place where they can use their
gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually
feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become overly impersonal and critical</li>
		<li>Be intrusive and directive—giving orders without
listening</li>
		<li>Become abrasive and verbally aggressive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ENTJs to give less attention to their non-
preferred Feeling and Sensing parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Fail to notice or value another’s need for personal con-
nection, appreciation, and praise</li>
		<li>Fail to factor into their plans the needs of others for sup-
port and processing time</li>
		<li>Overlook specifics and realistic factors that are necessary
to carry their plans to completion</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ENTJs can be overwhelmed by self-doubt, feel alone and unappreciated, and be unable to
express their distress to others.</p>
