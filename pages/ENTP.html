		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert i<strong>N</strong>tuiting <strong>T</strong>hinking <strong>P</strong>erceiving</h1>
<h5><strong>Ne - Ti - Fe - Si</strong></h5>
		<p>Quick, ingenious, stimulating, alert, and outspoken. Resourceful in solving new and challenging problems. Adept at generating conceptual possibilities and then analyzing them strategically. Good at reading other people. Bored by routine, will seldom do the same thing the same way, apt to turn to one new interest after another.
</p>
		
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ENTP preferences constantly scan the environ-
ment for opportunities and possibilities. They see patterns
and connections not obvious to others and at times seem
able to see into the future. They are adept at generating con-
ceptual possibilities and then analyzing them strategically.</p>
<p>ENTPs are good at understanding how systems work
and are enterprising and resourceful in maneuvering within
them to achieve their ends.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ENTP's</h3>
	<p>ENTPs are enthusiastic innovators. Their world is full of
possibilities, interesting concepts, and exciting challenges.
They are stimulated by difficulties, quickly devising creative responses and plunging into activity, trusting their
ability to improvise. They use their Intuition primarily
externally and enjoy exercising ingenuity in the world.
ENTPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Creative, imaginative, and clever</li>
		<li>Theoretical, conceptual, and curious</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENTPs use their Thinking primarily internally to ana-
lyze situations and their own ideas and to plan. They
admire competence, intelligence, precision, and efficiency.
ENTPs are usually</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Analytical, logical, rational, and objective</li>
		<li>Assertive and questioning</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ENTPs are enterprising, resourceful, active, and ener-
getic. They respond to challenging problems by creating
complex and global solutions. They are usually adept at
“reading” other people, seeing how to motivate them, and
assuming leadership. They can do almost anything that
captures their interest.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ENTPs are spontaneous and adaptable. They find schedules
and standard operating procedures confining and work
around them whenever possible. They are remarkably
insightful about the attitudes of others, and their enthusi-
asm and energy can mobilize people to support their vision.</p>
	<p>Their conversational style is customarily challenging
and stimulating because they love to debate ideas. They are
fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal
sparring. When they express their underlying Thinking
principles, however, they may speak with an intensity and
abruptness that seem to challenge others. Others usually
see ENTPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Independent, autonomous, and creative</li>
		<li>Lively, enthusiastic, and energetic</li>
		<li>Assertive and outspoken</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ENTPs in
the development and expression of their Thinking and
Intuitive preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, they may not
have reliable ways to evaluate their insights and make
plans to carry them through. Then they go from enthusiasm to enthusiasm with little actually accomplished.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, they may not
take in enough relevant information, resulting in “in-
sights” unrelated to current reality.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ENTPs do not find a place where they can use their
gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually
feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become brash, rude, and abrasive</li>
		<li>Criticize others, especially those who seem to them to be
inefficient or incompetent</li>
		<li>Become rebellious and combative</li>
		<li>Become scattered—unable to focus</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ENTPs to give less attention to their non-
preferred Sensing and Feeling parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Not take care of the details and routine required to
implement their insights</li>
		<li>Not give enough weight to the impact of their ideas and
plans on others</li>
		<li>Be excessively and inappropriately “challenging and
stimulating”</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ENTPs can be overwhelmed by de-
tail, losing their ability to generate possibilities. Then they
focus on a minor or distorted detail, thinking that it is
supremely important.</p>
