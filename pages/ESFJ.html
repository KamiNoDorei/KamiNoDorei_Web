		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>
<h5><strong>Fe - Si - Ne - Ti</strong></h5>
		<p>Warmhearted, conscientious, and cooperative. Want harmony in their environment, work with determination to establish it. Like to work with others to complete tasks accurately and on time. Loyal, follow through even in small matters. Notice what others need in their day-by-day lives and try to provide it. Want to be appreciated for who they are and for what they contribute.</p>
<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ESFJ preferences like to organize people and
situations and then work with others to complete tasks
accurately and on time. They are conscientious and loyal,
following through even in small matters, and they want
others to be the same. They value security and stability</p>
<p>Sociable and outgoing, ESFJs enjoy celebrations and traditions and bring a very personal caring to the workplace
and home. They want to be appreciated for themselves and
for what they give to others.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ESFJ's</h3>
	<p>ESFJs use their Feeling primarily externally and radiate
warmth and energy. They are encouraged by approval and
hurt by indifference or unkindness. Conflict-filled or tense
situations make them uncomfortable, and they work to
ensure these don’t occur. ESFJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Warm, sympathetic, and helpful</li>
		<li>Personable, cooperative, and tactful</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESFJs focus on the present and base decisions on experience and facts. Though they enjoy variety, they adapt well
to routine and don’t like work that demands mastery of
abstract ideas or impersonal analysis. They enjoy their possessions and take good care of them. ESFJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Practical, realistic, and down-to-earth</li>
		<li>Decisive, thorough, and consistent</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESFJs are sensitive to the needs of each individual in
their environment and good at providing practical caring.
Much of their pleasure and satisfaction comes from the
comfort and pleasure of others.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ESFJs are energized by interaction with others and genuinely interested in others’ lives and concerns. They feel
most comfortable in structured situations and enjoy creating order, structure, and schedules. They prefer to do things
the traditional and accepted way.</p>
	<p>For the sake of harmony, ESFJs will agree with others
when they can. However, they also have strong values,
which they express clearly and confidently when they think
it is appropriate.</p>
	<p>ESFJs value family and social ties. They enjoy belonging
and are good at celebrations and traditions. Others usually
see ESFJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Sociable, outgoing, enthusiastic, and energetic</li>
		<li>Organized and orderly</li>
		<li>Committed to preserving traditions</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ESFJs in
the development and expression of their Sensing and Feeling preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, ESFJs may not
take in much information before making decisions and
jump to conclusions before fully understanding a situation. They may then impose those decisions on everyone
around them.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, they may be
tentative and uncertain, accepting the judgments of others too quickly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ESFJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts
and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel
frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Doubt themselves and focus their attention entirely on
satisfying the needs of others</li>
		<li>Worry and feel guilty</li>
		<li>Become controlling in their push for harmony—“we will
all get along”</li>
		<li>Become overly sensitive, imagining slights where none
was intended</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ESFJs to give less attention to their non-
preferred Thinking and Intuitive parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Find it difficult to acknowledge and deal with the truth
of problems with people or things they care about</li>
		<li>Support those in charge or the standard procedures too
uncritically</li>
		<li>Fail to see wider possibilities or alternative ways of doing
things</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ESFJs may find themselves uncharacteristically critical of others and of themselves. Their negative thoughts and opinions then trouble them greatly.</p>
