		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>P</strong>erceiving</h1>
<h5><strong>Se - Fi - Ne - Ti</strong></h5>
		<p>Outgoing, friendly, and accepting. Exuberant lovers of life, people, and material comforts. Enjoy working with others to make things happen. Bring common sense and a realistic approach to their work, and make work fun. Flexible and spontaneous, adapt readily to new people and environments. Learn best by trying a new skill with other people.</p>
		
		
<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ESFP preferences are exuberant lovers of life.
They live in the moment and find enjoyment in people,
food, clothes, animals, the natural world, and activities.
They seldom let rules interfere with their lives, focusing on
meeting human needs in creative ways.</p>
<p>ESFPs are excellent team players, oriented to getting the
task done with a maximum amount of fun and a minimum
amount of fuss.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ESFP's</h3>
	<p>ESFPs are interested in people and new experiences.
Because they learn more from doing than from studying or
reading, they tend to plunge into things, learning as they
go. They appreciate their possessions and take pleasure in
them. ESFPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Observant</li>
		<li>Practical, realistic, and specific</li>
		<li>Active, involved in immediate experiences</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESFPs make decisions by using their personal values.
They use their Feeling judgment internally to make decisions by identifying and empathizing with others. They are
good at interpersonal interactions and often play the role of
peacemaker. Thus, ESFPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Generous, optimistic, and persuasive</li>
		<li>Warm, sympathetic, and tactful</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESFPs are keen observers of human behavior. They seem
to sense what is happening with other people and respond
quickly to their practical needs. They are especially good at
mobilizing people to deal with crises.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ESFPs get a lot of fun out of life and are fun to be with; their
exuberance and enthusiasm draw others to them. They are
flexible, adaptable, congenial, and easygoing. They seldom
plan ahead, trusting their ability to respond in the moment
and deal effectively with whatever presents itself. They hate
structure and routine and will generally find ways to get
around them.</p>
	<p>ESFPs tend to learn by doing, by interacting with their
environment. They usually dislike theory and written
explanations. Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs,
though they do well when they see the relevance and are
allowed to interact with people or the topics being studied.
Others usually see ESFPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Resourceful and supportive</li>
		<li>Gregarious, fun-loving, playful, spontaneous</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ESFPs in
the development and expression of their Feeling and Sensing preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, ESFPs may get
caught up in the interactions of the moment, with no
mechanism for weighing, evaluating, or anchoring
themselves.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, they may focus
on the sensory data available in the moment. Their decisions may then be limited to gratification of their sensual
desires, particularly those involving interactions with
other people.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ESFPs do not find a place where they can use their
gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually
feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become distracted and overly impulsive</li>
		<li>Have trouble accepting and meeting deadlines</li>
		<li>Overpersonalize othersâ€™ actions and decisions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ESFPs to give less attention to their non-
preferred Intuitive and Thinking parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Fail to look at long-term consequences, acting on imme-
diate needs of themselves and others,</li>
		<li>Avoid complex or ambiguous situations and people</li>
		<li>Put enjoyment ahead of obligations</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ESFPs may feel overwhelmed internally by negative possibilities. They then put energy into
developing simplistic global explanations for their negative
pictures.</p>
