		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>T</strong>hinking <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>
<h5><strong>Te - Si - Ne - Fi </strong></h5>
		<p>Practical, realistic, matter-of-fact. Decisive, quickly move to implement decisions. Organize projects and people to get things done, focus on getting results in the most efficient way possible. Take care of routine details. Have a clear set of logical standards, systematically follow them and want others to also. Forceful in implementing their plans.</p>
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ESTJ preferences like to organize projects, operations, procedures, and people and then act to get things
done. They live by a set of clear standards and beliefs, make a systematic effort to follow these, and expect the same of
others. They value competence, efficiency, and results and display them in their work and play.</p>
<p>ESTJs enjoy interacting and working with others, as long as the others are responsible about meeting deadlines and
completing assigned tasks. They work best in situations where clear, known problems can be solved with proven techniques.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ESTJ's</h3>
	<p>ESTJs take an objective approach to problem solving and are tough when the situation requires toughness. They use
their Thinking primarily externally to organize their lives and work, and they have little patience with confusion, inefficiency, or halfway measures. ESTJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Logical, analytical, and objectively critical</li>
		<li>Decisive, clear, and assertive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESTJs focus on the present—what is real and actual. They apply and adapt relevant past experience to deal with
problems, and they prefer jobs where results are immediate, visible, and tangible. ESTJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Practical, realistic, and matter-of-fact</li>
		<li>Systematic and pragmatic</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESTJs are usually excellent administrators because they understand systems and logistics. They can project the
steps needed to accomplish a task, foresee potential problems, assign responsibilities, and marshal resources. They cover all the bases, leave no loose ends, and get things done on time. When they see that things are not working, they will plan and act to correct the situation. Otherwise, they prefer proven procedures and systems. Their orientation is to tasks, action, and the bottom line.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>Because they naturally devise systems, procedures, and schedules, others rely on ESTJs to take charge and get
things done. Others may also find them overpowering at times because ESTJs are so certain about how things should be. Because they are clear and straightforward in their communication, people seldom have to wonder where they stand.</p>
	<p>ESTJs can be quite gregarious and generally enjoy interacting with people, especially around tasks, games, traditions, and family activities. They take relationship roles seriously and fulfill them responsibly. Others usually see ESTJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Conscientious and dependable</li>
		<li>Decisive, outspoken, and self-confident</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ESTJs in the development and expression of their Sensing and Thinking preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, ESTJs may decide too quickly before taking in enough information.
Then their decisions will reflect their previously formed judgments or biases.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, they may not have a reliable way of evaluating information and thus end up making inconsistent or overly harsh decisions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ESTJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become rigid and dogmatic</li>
		<li>Be intrusive, “know-it-all” experts, overpowering others and refusing to listen</li>
		<li>Get picky about details and be impatient with those who do not follow procedures exactly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ESTJs to give less attention to their non-preferred Feeling and Intuitive parts. If they neglect these too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Apply logic even when emotions and impacts on people need primary consideration</li>
		<li>Fail to respond to others’ needs for intimate connection and processing of feelings</li>
		<li>Not always see the wider ramifications of a seemingly simple, direct action</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ESTJs may feel alone and unappreciated and be unable to communicate their feeling of distress
and despair.</p>
