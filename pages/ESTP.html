		<h1><strong>E</strong>xtravert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>T</strong>hinking <strong>P</strong>erceiving</h1>
<h5><strong>Se - Ti - Fe - Ni</strong></h5>
		<p>Flexible and tolerant, they take a pragmatic approach focused on immediate results. Theories and conceptual explanations bore them - they want to act energetically to solve the problem. Focus on the here-and-now, spontaneous, enjoy each moment that they can be active with others. Enjoy material comforts and style. Learn best through doing.</p>
		
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ESTP preferences are energetic, active problem solvers, responding creatively to challenging situations in their environment. They seldom let rules or standard procedures interfere, finding new ways to use existing systems. They develop easy methods to do difficult things and make their work fun. They are flexible, adaptable, inventive, and
resourceful, can pull conflicting factions together, and are good team members</p>
<p>They are popular companions for activities (parties,
sports, or work) because of their zest for life and their
enjoyment of the moment.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ESTP's</h3>
	<p>ESTPs are interested in everything going on around them—activities, food, clothes, people, the outdoors, and everything that offers new experiences. Because they learn more from doing than from studying or reading, they tend to plunge into things, learning as they go, trusting their ability to respond resourcefully. ESTPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Observant</li>
		<li>Practical and realistic</li>
		<li>Active, involved in immediate experience</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESTPs make decisions by logical analysis and reasoning and can be tough when the situation calls for toughness.
They usually are</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Analytical, rational problem solvers</li>
		<li>Straightforward and assertive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ESTPs are expert at seeing the needs of the moment and reacting quickly to meet them. For the most part, they prefer to deal flexibly with what is, rather than make judgments. They good-naturedly take things as they are and seek satisfying solutions, rather than imposing a “should”
or “must” of their own.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ESTPs are strong in the art of living. They love life and immerse themselves in it; others respond to their enthusiasm and good humor. ESTPs are people of action. They usually dislike and avoid theory and written directions. Traditional schools can be difficult for people with these preferences, though ESTPs do well when they see the relevance and are allowed to experiment. Others usually see
ESTPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Gregarious, fun-loving, and spontaneous</li>
		<li>Adventurous risk takers</li>
		<li>Pragmatic troubleshooters</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ESTPs in the development and expression of their Thinking and
Sensing preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, ESTPs will not have a useful way of selecting amongst the barrage of
incoming sensory data. They may then have difficulty setting priorities or may make ill-founded decisions.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, they may focus on the Sensing data that are immediately available. Their
decisions may then be limited to gratification of their sensual desires, particularly those involving physical
challenge and risk.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ESTPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Have trouble accepting structure and meeting deadlines</li>
		<li>Focus entirely on excitement and activity, getting caught
up in external activities</li>
		<li>Put enjoying life ahead of important obligations</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ESTPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Intuitive and Feeling parts. If they neglect these too much, however, they</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>May not see the wider ramifications of their actions and decisions</li>
		<li>May forget dates and events that have special meaning to others</li>
		<li>May be unaware of the impact of their actions on others</li>
		<li>May be impatient with discussion or exploration of relationships</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ESTPs may have negative fantasies. They may imagine that others do not really care about them, then marshal and distort their Sensing data to provide themselves with “evidence” of this neglect.</p>
