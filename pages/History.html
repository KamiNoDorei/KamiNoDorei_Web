		<h1><strong>History</strong></h1>

		<p>The story behind the development of the Type Indicator is surely unique in the history of psychology. That story is the biography of a remarkable human being, or perhaps the saga of a whole family. It is instructive because it so clearly reveals the impact of parent on child and it is inspiring because it shows once more how much a single individual can achieve in the face of formidable obstacles.</p>
		<p>The story begins with the marriage in 1886 of two unusually gifted people: Katharine Cook and Lyman Briggs. Katharine, a thinker, a reader, a quiet observer became intrigued with similarities and differences in human personality about the time of World War 1. She began to develop her own typology, largely through the study of biography, and she then discovered that Jung had evolved a similar systems which she quickly accepted and began to explore and elaborate. Lyman was a versatile scientist when american science was in swaddling clothes and he became a dominant figure during the first half of the twentieth century in establishing science as a crucial force in the halls of government. As director of National Bureau of Standards, energy and in the exploration of the stratosphere and of Antarctica. Although honored with numerous awards and memorialized by the establishment of Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University. Dr, Briggs was remarkable for his modesty, humility, and compassion.</p>
		<p>The Briggs had one child, Isabel, whom they educated at home except for year or two in public school. Isabel Briggs entered Swarthmore College at age 16 and was graduated first in her class in 1919. In her junior year, she married Clarence Myers. Until the outbreak of World War II, she functioned as a mother and home maker, thought she found time to publish two successful mystery novels, one of which won a prize over a story by Erle Stanley Gardner.</p>
		<p>The suffering and tragedies of the war stirred Myers’s desire to do something that might help people understand each other and avoid destructive conflicts. Having long since absorbed her mother’s admiration of Jungian typology, she determined to devise a method making the theory of practical use. Thus was born the idea of a “type indicator.”</p>
		<p>With no formal training in psychology or statistics, with no academic sponsorship or research grants, Myers began the painstaking task of developing an item pool that would tap the attitudes, feelings, perceptions, and behaviours of the different psychological types as she and her mother had come to understand them. Her adolescent children and their classmates were early guinea pigs but anyone whose type Myers could judge was apt to be asked to contribute ideas or to respond to items.
</p>
		<p>An habitual reader, she haunted libraries to teach herself what she needed to know of statistics and psychometrics. She apprenticed herself to Edward N. Hay, who later founded one of the first successful personnel consulting firms in the United States. She persuaded countless school principals in western Pennsylvania to allow her to test their students. And she spent many a long evening scoring questions and tabulating data.</p>
		<p>For the fist decade or so of this work, Myers received little external reinforcement, except from members of her family. Through her father, she meet a medical school dean who allowed her to test his students, an entree which she expanded through the years until she had MBTI results for more than 5000 medical students and 10000 nurses.</p>
		<p>The response to Myer’s efforts from organized psychology was certainly cool if not hostile. In the first place, the measurement of personality was considered a dubious enterprise by many psychologists. Furthermore, among those few who were interested in personality theory and measurement, typologies were not in good repute. Trait and factor scales was were the focus of research and surely Myer's lack of establishment credentials didn’t help the MBTI win acceptance. There is no evidence that Myers was in the least daunted by either the skeptics or the critics. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she continued to corner principals and deans in their offices and extract agreements for administering the MBTI.</p>
		<p>Myers’s work did attract favorable attentions from a few assessment experts. Henry Chauncey, the thoughtful head of Educational Testing Service, was sufficiently impressed with the Type Indicator to approach Myers with a proposal for ETS to distribute the test for research purposes. Not everyone at ETS shared Chauncey’s enthusiasm and except for publication of a manual in 1962, the MBTI did not experience substantial development under ETS auspices. Donald T. MacKinnon, the distinguished director of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California, added the Indicator to the tests used in assessing creative persons and published supportive findings. Professor Harold Grant of Michigan State and Auburn Universities and Dr. Mary McCaulley of the University of Florida also undertook significant research with the instrument.</p>
		<p>in 1975 publication of the MBTI was transferred to Consulting Psychologists Press, and the Center for Applications of Psychological Type was organized as a service and research laboratory for the Indicator. Recent years have seen the establishment of a journal of research and the formation of an association of users of the MBTI. Such widespread acceptance might have persuaded most researchers past age 75 to lay down their calculators and pencils, but not Isabel Myers. At the age of 82 she was at work on a revised manual for the MBTI and she corrected the proof for Gifts Differing long after she was profoundly weakened by her final illness.</p>
		<p>Although it was already apparent during Myers’s last year that the Type Indicator would probably become the mot widely used personality measure for non psychiatric populations, Myers never showed the degree of vanity or conceit such as achievement might warrant: she remained pleased, grateful, and ever enthusiastic about the usefulness of the Indicator. Nor was there ever a hint of bitterness for all the years of condescension and rejection.
