		<h1><strong>I</strong>ntrovert i<strong>N</strong>tuiting <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>

<h5><strong>Ni - Fe - Ti - Se</strong></h5>

		<p>Seek meaning and connection in ideas, relationships, and material possessions. Want to understand what motivates people and are insightful about others. Conscientious and committed to their firm values. Develop a clear vision about how best to serve the common good. Organized and decisive in implementing their vision.</p>
		
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with INFJ preferences have a gift for intuitively understanding complex meanings and human relationships. They have faith in their insights and find that they
often empathically understand the feelings and motivations of people before the others themselves are aware of them. They combine this empathic understanding with the drive and organization to implement global plans for enhancing people’s lives.</p>
<p>INFJs have a visionary grasp of human relationships and possibilities, which, when articulated, can elevate and inspire others.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of INFJ's</h3>
	<p>INFJs seek meaning and connection in their lives and have little use for details unless they fit with their inner vision.
They use their Intuition primarily internally, where they develop complex pictures and understandings. INFJs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Insightful, creative, and visionary</li>
		<li>Conceptual, symbolic, and metaphorical</li>
		<li>Idealistic, complex, and deep</li>
	</ul>
	<p>INFJs apply personal values and empathize to understand others and make decisions. They are loyal to people
and institutions that exemplify their values but have little interest in those that do not. INFJs prefer to lead persuasively by sharing their vision. They are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Sensitive, compassionate, and empathic</li>
		<li>Deeply committed to their values</li>
	</ul>
	<p>INFJs want meaning and purpose in their work, their relationships, even their material possessions. They are invested in growth and development for themselves and significant others and are willing to consider unconventional paths to achieve these. They value the depth and complexity of their insights and creative gifts as well as those of others. They want to see these insights realized in the world.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>INFJs readily show compassion and caring for others, but they share their internal intuitions only with those they trust.
Because they keep this most valued, important part private, others may find them difficult to know. When they try to
communicate their internal sense of “knowing,” they often express it metaphorically and with complexity. They especially value authenticity and commitment in relationships.</p>
	<p>Though INFJs are usually reserved, they don’t hesitate to assert themselves when their values are violated. Then they
can be persistent and insistent. Others usually experience INFJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Private, even mysterious</li>
		<li>Intense and individualistic</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported INFJs in the development and expression of their Feeling and Intuitive preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, INFJs may not have reliable ways of making decisions and accomplishing their goals. Then, their valuable insights and creativity stay locked inside.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, they may not take in enough information or take in only what fits with
their internal pictures. Then they will make ill-founded decisions based on distorted or limited information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If INFJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel
frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Not give others the information they used to arrive at a decision, and thus seem arbitrary</li>
		<li>Base their judgments on little data, on a sense of “knowing” that has little basis in reality</li>
		<li>Withdraw their energy and insight</li>
		<li>Become resentful and critical</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for INFJs to give less attention to their non-preferred Sensing and Thinking parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Be unable to verbalize their inner insights in a way that others can understand</li>
		<li>Fail to check their insights against reason and practicality, and end up following a vision that has little possibil-
ity of being realized</li>
		<li>Become single minded in pursuit of a vision</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, INFJs may become obsessed with data they normally would consider irrelevant or over-indulge in Sensing activities such as watching TV reruns, overeating, or buying things that have little meaning for them.</p>
