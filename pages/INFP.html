		<h1><strong>I</strong>ntrovert i<strong>N</strong>tuiting <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>P</strong>erceiving</h1>
		
		<h5><strong>Fi - Ne - Si - Te</strong></h5>

		<p>Idealistic, loyal to their values and to people who are important to them. Want an external life that is congruent with their values. Curious, quick to see possibilities, can be catalysts for implementing ideas. Seek to understand people and to help them fulfill their potential. Adaptable, flexible, and accepting unless a value is threatened.
</p>
<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with INFP preferences have an inner core of values that guides their interactions and decisions. They want to
be involved in work that contributes to both their own growth and inner development and those of others—to have a purpose beyond their paycheck. They make a prior-
ity of clarifying their values and living in congruence with them.</p>
<p>INFPs recognize and honor the emotional and psychological needs of others, even when others may not have rec-
ognized or expressed their own needs.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of INFP's</h3>
	<p>INFPs primarily use their Feeling preference internally where they make decisions based on their values of self-
understanding, individuality, and growth. Living by moral commitments to what they believe in is crucial to INFPs.
They are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Sensitive, concerned, and caring</li>
		<li>Idealistic and loyal to their ideas</li>
	</ul>
	<p>INFPs enjoy reading, discussing, and reflecting on possibilities for positive change in the future. They are curious
about ideas and quick to see connections and meanings. INFPs are likely to</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Be curious and creative</li>
		<li>Have long-range vision</li>
	</ul>
	<p>INFPs are usually fascinated by opportunities to explore the complexities of human personality—their own and others’. They tend to work in bursts of energy and are capable of great concentration and output when fully engaged in a project. They are generally faithful in fulfilling obligations related to people, work, or ideas to which they are committed, but they can have difficulty performing routine work
that has little meaning for them.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>INFPs find structures and rules confining and prefer to work autonomously. They are adaptable and flexible until something violates their inner values. Then they stop adapting. The resulting expression of value judgments can
emerge with an intensity that is surprising to others.</p>
	<p>INFPs tend to be reserved and selective about sharing their most deeply held values and feelings. They value relationships based on depth, authenticity, true connection, and mutual growth. INFPs prize most those who take time to understand their values and goals. Others usually see INFPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Sensitive, introspective, and complex</li>
		<li>Original and individual</li>
		<li>Sometimes difficult to understand</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported INFPs in the development and expression of their Intuitive and Feeling preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Intuition, INFPs may not have reliable ways to take in information and may fail to notice the realities of situations. Then they may make decisions based solely on personal values and find it difficult to translate their values into action.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, they may not take time for the inner valuing process by which they make their best decisions, instead going from one exciting possibility to another and achieving little.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If INFPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Have uncharacteristic difficulty expressing themselves verbally</li>
		<li>Withdraw from people and situations</li>
		<li>Not give enough information to others, especially about important values</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for INFPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Thinking and Sensing parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become easily discouraged about the contrast between their ideals and accomplishments</li>
		<li>Reject logical reasoning even in situations that require it, asserting the supremacy of their internal viewpoint</li>
		<li>Be impractical and have difficulty estimating the resources required to reach a desired goal</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, INFPs may begin seriously doubting their own competence and that of others, becoming overly critical and judgmental.</p>
