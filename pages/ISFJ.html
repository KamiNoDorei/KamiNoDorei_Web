		<h1><strong>I</strong>ntrovert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>
<h5><strong>Si - Fe - Ti - Ne</strong></h5>
		<p>Quiet, friendly, responsible, and conscientious. Committed and steady in meeting their obligations. Thorough, painstaking, and accurate. Loyal, considerate, notice and remember specifics about people who are important to them, concerned with how others feel. Strive to create an orderly and harmonious environment at work and at home.</p>
		
<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ISFJ preferences are dependable and considerate, committed to the people and groups with which they
are associated, and faithful in carrying out responsibilities. They work with steady energy to complete jobs fully and on time. They will go to great trouble to do something they see as necessary but dislike being required to do anything that
doesn’t make sense to them.</p>
<p>ISFJs focus on what people need and want, and they establish orderly procedures to be sure those needs and wants are fulfilled. They take roles and responsibilities seriously and want others to do the same. Family relationships
and responsibilities are extremely important to ISFJs, who fulfill their roles conscientiously and expect other family
members to do the same.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ISFJ's</h3>
	<p>ISFJs have a realistic and practical respect for facts. They use their Sensing primarily internally, where they have a
wealth of stored information. They remember clearly the details of things that have personal meaning for them, such
as tones of voice and facial expressions. Thus, ISFJs are
likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Practical and realistic</li>
		<li>Concrete and specific</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISFJs use Feeling to make decisions based on personal values and concern for others. They value harmony and cooperation and work to create them. Thus, they are likely
to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Cooperative and thoughtful of others</li>
		<li>Kind and sensitive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Their opinions are firm because their decisions are based on careful application of their clear values and their wealth
of stored data. ISFJs respect established procedures and authority, believing that these have persisted because they
function well. Therefore they will support change only when new data show it will be of practical benefit to people.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ISFJs are unassuming and quiet in their interactions, often putting the needs of others—especially family members—
ahead of their own. They are uncomfortable with confrontation and will go a long way to accommodate others, though their respect for traditions and people’s feelings can
lead them to challenge actions they perceive as hurtful or insensitive. People see their values, their desire for structure
and closure, their kindness. What others may not see is the wealth of rich, accurate internal Sensing impressions and memories. Others usually see ISFJs as</p>
	
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Quiet, serious, and conscientious</li>
		<li>Considerate, good caretakers</li>
		<li>Honoring commitments, preserving traditions</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ISFJs in the development and expression of their Feeling and Sens-
ing preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, ISFJs may not have reliable ways of dealing with the world and instead focus solely on their Sensing memories and impressions.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, they may rush into value judgments or taking care of others without
considering the realities.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ISFJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become rigid in supporting hierarchy, authority, and procedures</li>
		<li>Feel unappreciated, resentful—complain a lot</li>
		<li>Be overly focused on immediate impacts of decisions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ISFJs to give less attention to their non-preferred Intuitive and Thinking parts. If they neglect these too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Not see the wider ramifications of current decisions or procedures</li>
		<li>Find it difficult to assert their needs</li>
		<li>Be uncomfortable applying impersonal criteria to decisions, even when needed</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ISFJs can get caught up in “catastrophizing”—imagining a host of negative possibilities. They
may then express these without their usual consideration for the impact on people around them.</p>
