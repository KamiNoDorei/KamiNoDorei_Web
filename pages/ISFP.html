		<h1><strong>I</strong>ntrovert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>P</strong>erceiving</h1>
<h5><strong>Fi - Se - Ni - Te</strong></h5>
		<p>Quiet, friendly, sensitive, and kind. Enjoy the present moment, what's going on around them. Like to have their own space and to work within their own time frame. Loyal and committed to their values and to people who are important to them. Dislike disagreements and conflicts, do not force their opinions or values on others.
</p>
		
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>ISFPs live in the present with a quiet sense of joyfulness; they want time to experience each moment. They prize the
freedom to follow their own course, have their own space, and set their own time frame, and they give the same freedom and tolerance to others. They are faithful in fulfilling obligations to people and things that are important to them.</p>
<p>ISFPs take time to develop intimacy with others, but, once they do, those relationships are very important. They
express their devotion to others spontaneously in many
quiet ways.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ISFP's</h3>
	<p>ISFPs are guided by a strong core of inner values and want their outer life to demonstrate those values. They want their
work to be more than just a job; they want to contribute to people’s well-being or happiness. They don't enjoy routine
but will work with energy and dedication when doing something they believe in. ISFPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Trusting, kind, and considerate</li>
		<li>Sensitive and gentle</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISFPs are acutely aware of the specifics and realities of the present—the people and the world around them. They
learn by doing more than by reading or hearing and get involved in day-by-day caretaking activities. ISFPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Observant</li>
		<li>Realistic, practical, concrete, and factual</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISFPs are attuned to the feelings and needs of others and flexible in responding to them. They often have an affinity for nature and for beauty in all living things—people, plants, and animals. They prize most those who take time to understand their values and goals and who support them in achieving those goals in their own way.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ISFPs are adaptable and flexible unless something that matters strongly to them is endangered; then they stop adapt-
ing. They care deeply about people but may show it through doing things for others more than through words.</p>
	<p>ISFPs tend to be quiet and unassuming, and their warmth, enthusiasm, and playful humor may not be apparent to people who don’t know them well. They prefer to observe and support rather than organize situations; they have little wish to dominate.</p>
	<p>ISFPs may be underestimated by others and may also underrate themselves. They often take for granted what they do well and make too much of the contrast between their inner standards and their actual behavior and accomplishments. Others usually see ISFPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Quiet, reserved, and private—hard to know well</li>
		<li>Spontaneous and tolerant</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ISFPs in the development and expression of their Sensing and Feeling preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, ISFPs may have no reliable way of getting accurate data about the external world or of actualizing their values. Their decisions will be based on little information and be overly personal.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Feeling, they may get caught up in Sensing realities and not take time for the internal valuing process by which they make their best decisions. They may avoid decision making, allowing others or circumstances to decide for them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ISFPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel
frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Withdraw from people and situations</li>
		<li>Be excessively self-critical</li>
		<li>Passively resist structures and rules</li>
		<li>Feel unappreciated and undervalued</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ISFPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Thinking and Intuitive parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Reject or not take seriously logical systems</li>
		<li>Feel ill-equipped to deal with complexity</li>
		<li>Not always see the wider ramifications of their specific,
immediate decisions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ISFPs can become uncharacteristically critical of themselves and others, verbalizing harsh and negative judgments.</p>
