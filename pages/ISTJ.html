		<h1><strong>I</strong>ntrovert <strong>S</strong>ensing <strong>T</strong>hinking <strong>J</strong>udging</h1>
		<h5><strong>Si - Te - Fi - Ne</strong></h5>

		<p>Quiet, serious, earn success by thoroughness and dependability. Practical, matter-of-fact, realistic, and responsible. Decide logically what should be done and work toward it steadily, regardless of distractions. Take pleasure in making everything orderly and organized - their work, their home, their life. Value traditions and loyalty.
</p>
		
		<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>ISTJs have a strong sense of responsibility and great loyalty to the organizations, families, and relationships in their lives. They work with steady energy to fulfill commitments as stated and on time. They go to almost any trouble to complete something they see as necessary but balk at doing anything that doesn't make sense to them.</p>
<p>ISTJs generally prefer to work alone and be accountable for the results; however, they are comfortable working in teams when that is necessary to do the job right, when roles are clearly defined, and when everyone fulfills assigned responsibilities. Competence and responsibility are ex-tremely important to ISTJs, who expect others to be as dutiful and trustworthy as they require themselves to be.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ISTJ's</h3>
	<p>ISTJs have a profound respect for facts. They use their Sensing primarily internally, where they have a storehouse of information upon which they draw to understand the present. Thus, they are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Practical, sensible, and realistic</li>
		<li>Systematic</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISTJs use Thinking in decision making, taking an objec-tive, logical, and tough-minded approach. Their focus is on the task or system as a whole, rather than on individuals. Thus, ISTJs tend to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Logical and analytical</li>
		<li> Detached and Reasonable</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISTJs are clear and steadfast in their opinions because they have arrived at them by carefully and thoroughly applying logical criteria based on their experience and knowledge. They believe standard procedures exist because such procedures work. ISTJs will support change only when facts demonstrate that such change will bring better results.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ISTJs are sociable when comfortable in the roles they are playing; however, they generally do not share their wealth of rich Sensing observations and memories except with close friends. Others see their standards and judgments, their desire for structure and schedules, but they may not see their individual, sometimes humorous, private reactions.</p>
	<p>It can be hard for ISTJs to see the sense in needs that differ widely from their own; but, once they are convinced that something matters to a person they care about, that need becomes a fact. They then go to great lengths to meet the need, even while continuing to think it doesn’t make sense. Others usually see ISTJs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Calm, reserved, and serious</li>
		<li>Consistent and orderly</li>
		<li>Valuing traditions</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ISTJs in the development and expression of their Thinking and Sensing preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, ISTJs may not have reliable ways of dealing with the world and instead may focus solely on their memories and internal data.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, they may rush into premature judgments and actions without considering new information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ISTJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become rigid about time, schedules, and procedures— go “by the book”</li>
		<li>Be critical and judgmental of others</li>
		<li>Find it diff i cult to delegate—to trust anyone else to do the job right</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ISTJs to give less attention to their non-preferred Intuitive and Feeling parts. If they neglect these too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Not see the wider ramif i cations of current, expedient decisions</li>
		<li>Concentrate on logic so much they don’t consider impacts on people</li>
		<li>Fail to respond appropriately to others’ needs for con-nection and intimacy</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ISTJs may be unable to use their cus-tomary calm, reasonable judgment and get caught up in “catastrophizing”—imagining a host of negative possibili-ties for themselves and others.</p>
