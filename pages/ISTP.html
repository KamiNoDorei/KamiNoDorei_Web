		<p>Tolerant and flexible, quiet observers until a problem appears, then act quickly to find workable solutions. Analyze what makes things work and readily get through large amounts of data to isolate the core of practical problems. Interested in cause and effect, organize facts using logical principles, value efficiency.</p>
		
<h3>At Their Best</h3>
<p>People with ISTP preferences carefully observe what is going on around them. Then, when the need arises, they
move quickly to get to the core of a problem and solve it with the greatest efficiency and the least effort. They are
interested in how and why things work but find abstract theories uninteresting unless they can quickly apply them. They often function as troubleshooters.</p>
<p>ISTPs resist regimentation and rules, thrive on variety and novelty, and enjoy the challenge of solving a new, concrete, extensive problem.</p>
		<h3>Characteristics of ISTP's</h3>
	<p>ISTPs resist regimentation and rules, thrive on variety and novelty, and enjoy the challenge of solving a new, concrete, extensive problemISTPs use their Thinking primarily internally to see the essential structure underlying the facts. Their minds seem to work almost like computers, organizing data, reasoning impersonally and objectively. They make rational decisions based on a great deal of concrete data. ISTPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Detached and objective critics</li>
		<li>Analytical and logical problem solvers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISTPs are realists, focusing on what is and what can be done with it, rather than on theoretical possibilities. They are often creative at dealing with the immediate problems and good at hands-on tasks. ISTPs are likely to be</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Practical and realistic</li>
		<li>Factual and pragmatic</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ISTPs are expedient and believe in economy of effort—doing only what is needed with the least possible discussion
and fuss. Their focus is on getting the desired results.</p>
	<h3>How Others May See Them</h3>
	<p>ISTPs are egalitarian and generally tolerant of a wide range of behavior—until their ruling logical principles are attacked. At that point, they can surprise others by expressing their firm and clear judgments. ISTPs listen and seem to agree because they are not disagreeing; later, others may
find the ISTP was analyzing and making internal judgments.</p>
	<p>With their constant scanning for information and focus on results, ISTPs will change course readily if they see another, more efficient way. Because of this, others sometimes have trouble “reading” them. They tend to be quiet and reserved, though they can be quite talkative in areas in which they have a lot of knowledge. Others usually see ISTPs as</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Adaptable, action-oriented risk takers</li>
		<li>Confident, independent, and self-determined</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Potential Areas for Growth</h3>
	<p>Sometimes life circumstances have not supported ISTPs in the development and expression of their Sensing and
Thinking preferences.</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>If they have not developed their Sensing, ISTPs may have no reliable way of getting accurate data about the external world or of translating their thoughts into action.</li>
		<li>If they have not developed their Thinking, they may get caught up in the realities around them and not take time
to do the internal logical processing they need to make good decisions. Then their actions may be haphazard responses to immediate needs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If ISTPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel
frustrated and may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Become cynical and negative critics</li>
		<li>Withdraw their attention and energy</li>
		<li>Postpone decisions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is natural for ISTPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Feeling and Intuitive parts. If they neglect these
too much, however, they may</p>
	<ul  class="List">
		<li>Overlook others’ emotional needs and values</li>
		<li>Not give sufficient weight to the impacts of their decisions on others</li>
		<li>Focus so intently on immediate results that they lose track of the long-term ramifications of their decisions
and actions</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under great stress, ISTPs may erupt outwardly in inappropriate displays of emotion. The resulting explosive
anger or hurt tearfulness is quite unnerving to others and embarrassing to the usually calm and controlled ISTP.</p>
