		<p>The J-P dichotomy is designed to identify the process a person tends to use in dealing with the outerworld, that is,with the extraverted part of life.</p>

		<h1><strong>J</strong>udging</h1>

		<p>A person who prefers using Judging (J) process typically uses either Thinking or Feeling (the Judging processes) when dealing with the outerworld. 
 It should be noted that Myers and Briggs believed this dichotomy was implicit in Jung's theory, but it was not explicitly described in Jung's writings.

They want to make decisions, come to closure, and move on. Their lives tend to be structured and organized, and they like to have things settled. Sticking to a plan and schedule is very important to them, and they are energized by getting things done.</p>
